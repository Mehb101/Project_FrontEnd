This is the frontend for the Pro-Tasker application. It is built using React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Axios, and React Router. The frontend communicates with the backend API using an environment variable called VITE_API_BASE_URL, which points to the deployed backend on Render. The app includes pages for registering, logging in, viewing all projects, viewing a single project, and managing tasks inside each project. I used React’s Context API to store the user’s authentication state and JWT token, and every Axios request automatically includes the token so users can only access their own data. The Dashboard page lets users create, update, delete, and view their projects. The Project page lets users create, edit, and delete tasks and update their status. The UI is styled with Tailwind and is responsive and simple to use. During development I used npm run dev with Vite, and for production I deployed the frontend on Render as a Static Site, using the dist folder generated from npm run build. A rewrite rule was added on Render so that React Router works correctly on page refresh. This frontend works together with the backend to give users a complete project and task management experience.
